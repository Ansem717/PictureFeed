class GalleryViewCell: UICollectionViewCell {

    
    @IBOutlet weak var imageView: UIImageView!
    
}

// One of the tutorials talked about creating a custom cell, with an outlet for a UIImageView. 
// The cell inherits from all things that UICollectionViewCell has, so it's not going to interrupt
// or change anything. Infact, this class only adds an image outlet. That's it.
